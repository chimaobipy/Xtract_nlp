    "c = nlp('The availability of energy-dense and compact batteries has galvanized interest in the electrification of transport and further integration of renewables in the grid. Rechargeable lithium-ion batteries are the batteries of choice today because they have the highest energy densities (∼250 W h/kg).(1,2) However, their energy densities and cost are currently insufficient to keep pace with our insatiable demand for longer range electric vehicles and a reduction in our carbon footprint.(1) Li-ion batteries use graphite as the anode, a mixture of carbonates as the electrolyte, and a transition metal oxide (TMO) such as LiCoO2 as the cathode. To obtain higher energy densities, battery chemistries such as lithium–high-voltage TMO (∼440 W h/kg), lithium–sulfur (∼650 W h/kg), and lithium–air (∼950 W h/kg) have been heavily explored.(1−4) These improvements in energy density are predicated on the use of lithium metal as the anode because of its high theoretical specific capacity (3860 mA h/gLi) and low reduction potential (−3.04 V).(2,5−7) However, lithium metal reacts significantly with the electrolyte (because of the low reduction potential) to generate a solid electrolyte interface (SEI).(8) Unlike in graphite where the SEI can be quite robust and sustains long-term cycling, the SEI on lithium metal is quite porous, and continuous electrolyte degradation leads to cell death.(9) Electrolyte stability against the cathode is also of great interest because of the existence of electrodes such as Ni-rich LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 (NMC 811) with capacities much higher than NMC 111 used commercially today. However, accessing the energy density in Ni-rich NMC 811 requires high charging cutoff potentials (at least 4.4 V or above).(10) Increasing the oxidative stability of electrolytes while maintaining stable lithium metal deposition/stripping and high ionic conductivities is a great challenge, because the electrochemical stability window shifts between different classes of electrolytes.(11)There are two classes of electrolytes that dominate the lithium metal literature: carbonates and ethers. Carbonates such as ethylene carbonate (EC) and ethyl methyl carbonate (EMC) are currently used in today’s lithium-ion batteries because of their high dielectric constant (and high ionic conductivities), and the ability of EC to form a robust SEI on graphite.(9) Unfortunately, when carbonates are used in lithium metal batteries, the SEI is porous, and side reactions with lithium metal are exacerbated, leading to low Coulombic efficiencies.(9,12) Therefore, typical carbonates used in lithium-ion batteries have been eschewed for ethers in lithium metal batteries. Ethers such as 1,3-dioxolane (DOL) and 1,2-dimethoxyethane (DME) also support high ionic conductivities, and high Coulombic efficiencies for lithium metal deposition and stripping.(13,14) However, ethers at typical 0.1 or 1 M salt concentrations cannot be used with Ni-rich NMC 811 or other high-voltage cathodes because of the low oxidative stability of ethers (less than 4 V vs Li/Li+).(14−16) Therefore, there is great need for the design and synthesis of new electrolytes to support both lithium metal and high-voltage cathodes.Several electrolyte engineering strategies are typically pursued to improve oxidative stability. For example, solvent-in-salt systems—with a high salt concentration in the electrolyte to decrease the “free” solvent concentration and mobility—have been shown to improve oxidative stability.(14,15,17,18) Unfortunately, the solvent-in-salt electrolytes have high viscosity, high cost, lower ionic conductivities, and slower reaction kinetics.(19−21) Another engineering approach involves additives such as hydrofluoroethers.(19) Hydrofluoroethers such as 1,1,2,2-tetrafluoroethyl-2,2,3,3-tetrafluoropropylether (TTE) and bis(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl) ether (BTFE) have found great use in lithium metal batteries as diluents for solvent-in-salt electrolytes.(22,23) These hydrofluoroethers do not dissolve any salt and have no ionic conductivity but have high oxidative stabilities (Figure 1).(24,25) Unfortunately, mixing these hydrofluoroethers (HFEs) with typical ethers does not significantly increase the oxidative stability of the overall electrolyte mixture. Therefore, a new approach (beyond electrolyte engineering) is highly desired to combine the high ionic conductivity of ether solvents with the high oxidative stability of hydrofluoroethers. Thus, we pursued an electrolyte chemistry approach.Figure 1Figure 1. Motivation and synthetic scheme. Illustration of typical challenges with common electrolytes. Ethers support ion conduction but have poor oxidative stability. Hydrofluoroethers have high oxidative stability but support no ion conduction. Simply mixing hydrofluoroethers and ethers at typical 0.1 or 1 M salt concentrations still suffers from poor oxidative stability. Covalently attaching an ether to the hydrofluoroether allows for both high ionic conductivity and oxidative stability (our approach). Synthesis of fluorinated ethers through deprotonation of fluorinated tetraethylene glycol (FTEG) and fluorinated triethylene glycol (FTriEG) and subsequent addition of varying alkoxy halides. The fluorinated segment is varied between FTEG and FTriEG to understand the effect of the fluorinated group, and the ether group is varied from MME to DME to DEG to understand the effect of ether type and length. Tetraglyme (shown) serves as the control for comparisons.Some ionically conductive fluorinated electrolytes have been synthesized by Balsara and DeSimone et al.,(26−30) but all of these systems have carbonate groups attached, which are undesired for lithium metal batteries as mentioned above. In this work, we show a novel method to combine high ionic conductivity with high oxidative stability in a single molecule by synthesizing a new class of fluorinated ether electrolytes (Figure 1). We vary the length and type of ether group, and the length of the fluorinated segment to obtain structure–property relationships. We show that the molecules (although liquid at room temperature with low molecular weight) actually have glass transitions instead of melting transitions of typical ethers. Ionic conductivity within this class of compounds is higher with longer ether groups and with a shorter fluorinated segment, and we show conductivities as high as 2.7 × 10–4 S/cm (at 30 °C) and lithium transference numbers higher than typical ethers (tetraglyme). In addition to the high ionic conductivity, these compounds also have high oxidative stabilities up to 5.6 V (at least 1.4 V greater than tetraglyme or a tetraglyme:TTE mixture), showing the powerful combination of covalently attaching an ether segment for high ionic conductivity and a fluorinated segment for high oxidative stability in a single molecule. Using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we study the influence of electrolyte structure on ionic transport, diffusivity, and salt solvation structure. Finally, we show that this class of electrolytes is promising for high-voltage Li-NMC 811 batteries supporting over 100 cycles at rates as high as C/5. Our approach to obtain high ionic conductivity and electrochemical stability in the same compound can be explored with other solvent classes such as nitriles and sulfones and increase the number of electrolytes of interest for battery chemistries. Designing new electrolytes with novel properties is essential to revolutionize our energy landscape and bring batteries closer to fulfilling their great promise.Results and DiscussionARTICLE SECTIONSJump ToRationale for Molecular DesignThe rationale for molecular design was guided by the need to combine the oxidative stability of hydrofluoroethers such as BTFE/TTE with the ionic conductivity properties of ethers (Figure 1). Ether solvents have high ionic conductivities but suffer from poor oxidative stability.(15,18) In contrast, hydrofluoroethers have high oxidative stability but cannot dissolve lithium salts.(19,24,25) Conventionally, the literature has pursued a mixing approach,(31) but as we will show, a simple mixture does not combine the benefits of both classes of compounds because the mixture is still limited by one of the components with low oxidative stability. In this work, we pursue a covalent approach where a fluorinated core is covalently bound to the ether “end group”. Hence, the fluorinated core can lead to high oxidative stability and support Ni-rich cathodes such as LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 (NMC 811) with a high charge cutoff, while the ether group imbues the compound with high salt dissolution and ionic conductivity (Figure 1). In this manner, the design accomplishes an ionically conductive fluorinated ether. We avoid carbonate functionality because of their poor stability against lithium metal.(9,12) We chose tetraglyme as our control because it has been heavily studied,(15,32,33) and the ether length is comparable to our synthesized fluorinated ethers. Meanwhile, our ability to vary the length of both the fluorinated and ether segments in a modular fashion allows for systematic study of structure–property relationships.Synthesis and Confirmation of StructureFluorinated ethers were synthesized by functionalizing fluorinated glycols with alkoxy halides (Figure 1). Commercially available fluorinated tetraethylene glycol (FTEG) and fluorinated triethylene glycol (FTriEG) were deprotonated using sodium hydride. After deprotonation, varying alkoxy halides were added to substitute the terminal group. The modular nature of this synthesis allows for a library of possible compounds. By moving from FTEG to FTriEG, we can understand the effect of the fluorinated length on ionic conductivity, oxidative stability, and subsequent properties. The ether length can be tuned from methyl methyl ether (MME) to dimethyl ether (DME) to understand the effect of the spacer group (methylene vs ethylene) while maintaining the total number of oxygen groups. A comparison of DME to diethylene glycol (DEG) makes it possible to understand the effect of ether length. We use alkoxy halides for ease of synthesis because halides are facile leaving groups, although their cost can be a hindrance. For DEG-FTEG, we synthesize using tosyl leaving groups showing the versatility of our approach (see the Experimental Section). Once functionalized, flash column chromatography was used to purify the compounds, and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy (Figure S1) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy (Figure S2) were used to confirm the structure and product purity.Thermal PropertiesThe thermal properties of the compounds were characterized. Figure S3 shows decomposition and/or evaporation profiles obtained using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), where the lengths of the ether and fluorinated segments dictate the temperature at which evaporation occurs. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was used to study the thermal behavior of the fluorinated ethers. Figure S4 shows cooling traces at a rate of 5 °C/min after a prior heating run. The starting glycol reactants (FTEG and FTriEG) have crystallization peaks (after the heating cycle created a melt), and tetraglyme also has a crystallization peak.(16) However, the fluorinated ethers do not have melting transitions, but glass transitions (Tg) around −21 °C. Despite the low scan rates used, the molecules are unable to pack to form a crystal, a behavior that has also been observed for other bulky small molecules.(34) Finally, the Tg seems insensitive to changes in either fluorinated or ether segments.Ionic Conductivity and Transport MechanismThe ionic conductivity of lithium salts dissolved in the fluorinated compounds was examined using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Figure 2a,b shows conductivity as a function of temperature for different salt concentration and fluorinated ether combinations. We chose lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)amide (LiFSA) salt for this work because it can dissolve in concentrations larger than 1 M in all the synthesized compounds (except for CH3-FTEG which was not studied further). Figure 2a shows that as the spacer group increases from (−CH2O−) in MME-FTEG to (−CH2CH2O−) in DME-FTEG, there is a 30× increase in ionic conductivity at 30 °C (Table S1). Furthermore, as one increases the ether length from DME-FTEG to DEG-FTEG, there is only a 6× increase. The FTriEG compounds in Figure 2b also corroborate the effect of ether length on ionic conductivity as observed with the FTEG compounds in Figure 2a. Furthermore, an increase in salt concentration from 0.1 to 1 M also leads to an increase in ionic conductivity as expected. Finally, as the fluorinated segment is shortened from FTEG to FTriEG, there is also an increase in ionic conductivity (Figure 2b). The 1 M LiFSA in DEG-FTriEG electrolyte has the highest ionic conductivity at 2.7 × 10–4 S/cm at 30 °C; conductivities in the range of 10–4 S/cm and above are relevant for electrochemical systems. However, the conductivity of 1 M LiFSA in tetraglyme is still an order of magnitude higher at 30 °C.Figure 2. Figure 2. Ionic transport and conductivity. Ionic conductivity as a function of LiFSA salt content (closed symbol −0.1 M, open symbol −1 M) for (a) FTEG compounds and (b) FTriEG compounds with tetraglyme as the control in both. All the data points in the conductivity plots have error bars representing the standard deviation from at least three different cells. (c) Activation energy obtained from Arrhenius fits of conductivity versus temperature for 0.1 M LiFSA salt concentration. (d) Lithium (7Li) cation and FSA (19F) anion diffusivities and lithium (7Li) transference number obtained through pulsed field gradient NMR for 0.1 M LiFSA in FTriEG compounds. The dashed line at 0.4 represents the lithium transference number in tetraglyme. Measured diffusivity for Li (1.28 × 10–6 cm2/s) and FSA (1.93 × 10–6 cm2/s) in 0.1 M LiFSA tetraglyme. Corresponding (e) lithium (7Li) and (f) fluorine (19F) shifts for the lithium cation and the FSA anion for 0.1 M LiFSA dissolved in FTriEG compounds and tetraglyme.The conductivity dependence on temperature can be fitted using an Arrhenius form (Figure S5) to obtain the activation energy barrier for ion transport. The insignificant shift in Tg precluded the use of the Vogel–Tammann–Fulcher (VTF) form. Although Figure 2a,b showed a direct correlation between ether length and conductivity, the correlation with activation energy is nuanced (Figure 2c and Figure S5). The activation energy is a function of only ether spacer type and ether length. For 0.1 M electrolytes, DME-FTriEG electrolyte has lower activation energies compared to MME-FTriEG, DEG-FTriEG, and tetraglyme. The difference in activation energy barrier is surprising because DEG-FTriEG and tetraglyme support higher ionic conductivities than DME-FTriEG. The FTEG compounds behave similarly (Figure 2c), and increasing the salt concentration does not change the activation energy trends between both the FTriEG and FTEG compounds (Figure S5).The different trends in activation energy barrier prompted further spectroscopic study of the ionic transport environment within the electrolytes. We use pulsed field gradient (PFG) NMR to probe lithium (7Li for Li+) and anion (19F for FSA–) diffusion. Figure 2d shows diffusivity within the FTriEG class of compounds. Remarkably, the trend for Li+ and FSA– diffusivity mirrors the activation energy trend in Figure 2c. Li+ and FSA– diffusivity is highest in DME-FTriEG than in MME or DEG-FTriEG. Despite the lower ionic conductivity in MME-FTriEG compared to DEG-FTriEG, lithium diffuses faster, an observation we partly attribute to the lower viscosity of MME compared to DEG-FTriEG (Table S2). Furthermore, within DME-FTriEG, FSA– diffuses faster than Li+ whereas Li+ diffuses faster than FSA– in MME and DEG-FTriEG. Using PFG NMR, Figure 2d shows that the lithium transference number (tLi+ = ) is higher in MME and DEG-FTriEG compared to DME-FTriEG. A similar trend in transference numbers is also observed for the FTEG class of compounds (Figure S6). Despite these differences, these compounds have higher lithium transference numbers compared to tetraglyme (tLi+ = 0.4). Figure S7 shows mean squared displacement (MSD) for 1 M LiFSA dissolved in MME-FTriEG, DME-FTriEG, and tetraglyme, and the lithium transference number trends match our experimental results; however, simulations tend to underestimate diffusion coefficients.(35,36) Balsara et al.(26−30) have shown that carbonate-terminated perfluoropolyether compounds also show a higher transference number compared to a carbonate solvent control. Furthermore, these compounds show higher transference numbers compared to previously reported LiTFSI in perfluoropolyether (PFPE):polyethylene glycol (PEG) blends.(31)The ion binding environment was also examined using 7Li and 19F NMR. An NMR capillary setup was used for 7Li NMR (see the Experimental Section) and the data referenced to a 1 M LiClO4 in acetonitrile internal standard (−2.80 ppm).(37) Within the FTriEG family, as one moves from MME to DME to DEG, an upfield shift is observed (Figure 2e), which could be due to stronger ion solvation or an increase in ion-pairing; unfortunately Figure 2e alone is insufficient to distinguish between the two as both phenomena will lead to upfield shifts.(38−40)Figure 2f shows the 19F chemical shift where a downfield trend is observed for FSA– as one increases the ether length. Compared to tetraglyme, the peaks are upfield, signaling increased Li+ ion-pairing with the FSA anion or also stronger binding between the FSA anion and the fluorinated ether.(38) Between Figure 2e and 2f, the shifts from MME to DME are much greater (Δ = 0.15 ppm 7Li and 0.34 ppm 19F) than moving from DME to DEG (Δ = 0.04 ppm 7Li and 0.05 ppm 19F), indicating that the spacer group effect especially relating to ionic solvation (−CH2O– to −CH2CH2O−) is more dominant than the ether length effect (−CH2CH2O– to −CH2CH2OCH2CH2O−). Figure S8 shows that similar chemical shift trends are observed within the FTEG class of compounds, although DEG-FTEG has more of a downfield shift compared to DEG-FTriEG. 7Li spin–lattice relaxation times (T1), where relaxation occurs by translational and rotational motion, were measured as a function of temperature for FTriEG and FTEG compounds (Figure S9).(22,41) As a quadrupolar nuclei, 7Li can also undergo quadrupolar relaxation mechanisms.(22)Figure S9 shows that tetraglyme has the longest T1, and the T1 decreases as one goes from MME to DEG (in both FTriEG and FTEG), with the DEG compounds having the shortest T1. Unfortunately, the T1 values correlate with viscosity of the fluorinated ethers, which does not allow for easy delineation on the impact of ion pair formation on T1 relaxation.Ionic Solvation StructureMolecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed to better understand the lithium and anion solvation environment within these fluorinated ethers (Figure 3 and Figure S10). Figure 3 shows radial distribution functions (RDFs) for the lithium cation and the FSA anion in tetraglyme and the FTriEG compounds at a 0.1 M concentration. As Figure 3a shows, the oxygen (with its lone pair) on the ether group (OCH2) of tetraglyme has the highest probability of being adjacent to the lithium cation. Figure S10 shows the RDF for CH3-FTEG, and both OCH2 and OCF2 are adjacent to the lithium cation. The high OCF2 peak coincides with the first peak of OCH2, implying that OCH2 and OCF2 have comparable interaction with Li+. Since OCF2 does not support lithium transport, this means that CH3-FTEG has poor solvation power for Li+, which may explain the observed low solubility of LiFSA in CH3-FTEG (<0.1 M LiFSA solubility). Comparing the RDFs for lithium in Figure 3b–d shows the ether group adjacent to the lithium cation. This supports the hypothesis shown in Figure 1 where the ether segment in the fluorinated ether coordinates with lithium and supports its transport. Comparing Figure 3bi,ci shows that as one moves from the methylene to the ethylene spacer unit, there is less interference from the carbon within the first solvation shell, and an increased probability of the carbon being in the next solvation shell. Also, looking at Figure 3bi,ci,di shows that as the ether length is increased, the probability of OCF2 in the lithium solvation shell diminishes. Again, this may help explain why increasing the ether length leads to higher ionic conductivities.Figure 3Figure 3. Salt solvation structure in the electrolyte. Radial distribution functions (RDFs) of 0.1 M LiFSA in the different electrolytes: (a) tetraglyme, (b) MME-FTriEG, (c) DME-FTriEG, and (d) DEG-FTriEG. The highlighted regions are to draw attention to the differences between the spectra for both the lithium cation and the FSA anion. The chemical structures are added for ease of comparison. −OCF2 and −OCH2 in the legends allow for differentiation of which oxygen atom is adjacent to either the cation or anion, where −OCF2 represents the oxygen from the fluorinated component, and −OCH2 represents the oxygen from the ether end groups. (i) Lithium cation and (ii) FSA anion for the respective electrolytes. The anion spectra in part ii refer to the interaction between the fluorine atom in the FSA anion and the respective compounds.The increase in transference number observed here was also observed by Balsara et al.(26,29) and attributed to the interaction between the fluorinated ether and the anion. We remarked about the nonlinear trend involving MME-, DME-, and DEG-FTriEG regarding the activation energy and lithium transference numbers in Figure 2c,d. Figure S11 shows RDF analyses at a 1 M LiFSA concentration in the fluorinated ether electrolytes, and they show that both F and H atoms from the solvent contribute significantly to the interaction with the FSA anion. Therefore, it appears that the fluorinated segment in these compounds interacts significantly with the fluorinated anion through the “fluorous effect” hence inhibiting anionic transport (which is desired): a hypothesis originally proposed by Balsara et al.,(29) but no conclusive evidence was provided until this work. However, for DME-FTriEG, Figure S11 shows that the binding between the ether group (labelled as the O–H peak) is much higher than in MME-FTriEG and DEG-FTriEG, slowing lithium ion diffusion and explaining the lower lithium transference number observed experimentally. Figure 2d corroborates the MD data by showing that FSA– diffuses faster than Li+ in DME-FTriEG (as also observed with tetraglyme). Therefore, the ether segment in the fluorinated ether coordinates with lithium while the fluorinated segment coordinates preferentially with the FSA anion. All these fluorinated ethers have higher transference numbers compared to tetraglyme because the fluorine group in the fluorinated ether interacts with the anion, albeit to different degrees.Oxidative and Reductive StabilityThe oxidative stability of these fluorinated ethers was explored. Our motivation for synthesizing this new class of electrolytes is to couple high ionic conductivity with high oxidative stability in a single molecule. Figure 4a shows a linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) plot with a scan rate of 0.1 mV/s from open circuit to 6 V. As the data remarkably shows, all the fluorinated ethers have oxidative voltages at least 1.4 V greater than tetraglyme (Table S1). Furthermore, the oxidative voltage is a function of ether length with MME-FTriEG and MME-FTEG showing excellent stability. We also studied the oxidative stability of a simple yet typically studied mixture of tetraglyme:TTE in a 1:1 volume ratio (1:1.45 molar ratio), and Figure 4a shows that the oxidative stability of the mixture is still poor compared to the synthesized fluorinated ethers, further validating our design strategy in Figure 1 that focuses on covalently attaching ethers to the fluorinated segment instead of simple mixing. The result is intriguing because, despite the presence of ethers in the synthesized fluorinated compounds, there is still a significant improvement in oxidative stability. For example, DEG-FTriEG has more ether groups than tetraglyme, but the oxidative voltage is still higher (>5.1 V vs 4 V). In addition, the oxidative stability in Li/SS cells is not influenced by increasing the salt concentration from 0.1 to 1 M (Figures S12 and S13). The inductive electron-withdrawing effect of fluorine shifts electron density away from the oxygen groups within the ether segment, decreasing the ether propensity for oxidation.(9,42,43) Another evidence of the shift in electron density is the lowered ability of the ether segment in the FTEG and FTriEG compounds to coordinate and transport lithium (Figure 2). We believe the accessibility of the ether group to the electrode surface is also limited in the fluorinated ether compared to tetraglyme, where the fluorinated segment may orient toward the electrode surface limiting ether accessibility to the surface. Somorjai et al.(44) have previously shown using sum frequency generation (SFG) vibrational spectroscopy that when a fluorinated compound is adjacent to an electrode (e.g., amorphous silicon), it reorients to expose the CF3 groups to the surface to form an ordered fluorine-dominated passivation layer on the electrode surface. Although our synthesized compounds do not have fluorinated terminal groups, our observation of high oxidative stability despite the presence of ethers lends credence to the importance of electrolyte orientation on oxidative stability. Our strategy could provide great utility in the design of new electrolytes with greater electrochemical stability.Figure 4Figure 4. Oxidative and reductive stability. (a) Linear sweep voltammetry at 0.1 mV/s with FTEG compounds, FTriEG compounds, tetraglyme, and a tetraglyme:TTE (1:1 v/v) mixture with a stainless steel (SS) working electrode and 0.1 M LiFSA salt concentration.

Potentiostatic holds with (f) NMC 811 as the working electrode in 0.1 M LiFSA in DEG-FTEG and the tetraglyme:TTE (1:1 v/v) mixture. (g) Cyclic voltammetry scanning reductively at 0.1 mV/s with 0.1 M LiFSA in FTEG compounds and a stainless steel working electrode. Reference and counter electrode: lithium metal. EC-EMC = ethylene carbonate:ethyl methyl carbonate. RT = room temperature.We also use potentiostatic holds to further probe the oxidative stability of the fluorinated compounds.(45) Using a stainless steel, aluminum, or Ni-rich NMC 811 electrode with different electrolytes, we hold the potential for 3 h at increasingly higher potentials and record the current response. If no undesired Faradaic reactions are occurring, the current should decay.(45) Potentiostatic hold experiments for long times are less susceptible to the influence of impurities that could lead to early current rise—earlier than the true compound oxidation—in LSV experiments. Therefore, we quote the oxidative voltages from potentiostatic hold experiments. Figure 4b shows current response as a function of voltage comparing tetraglyme and the simple tetraglyme:TTE (1:1 v/v) mixture with a stainless steel electrode. The tetraglyme or tetraglyme:TTE mixture shows an oxidative stability between 3.8 and 4 V, as previously reported.(46) Meanwhile, Figure 4c shows a similar setup but with the FTriEG compounds, and the oxidative stabilities increase up to 5.4–5.6 V. Significant increases in oxidative stability are also observed with the FTEG compounds (Figure S14 and Table S1). However, continuous stainless steel corrosion at earlier voltages is observed at 60 °C for both FTriEG compounds and tetraglyme (Figure S13). Although stainless steel electrodes provide great information on oxidative stability, they are not practically relevant. We also explored the oxidative stability of 1 M salt concentration in fluorinated ethers in commercially relevant Li/Al cells at room temperature and at 60 °C (Figure 4d,e). Aluminum is currently used as the current collector in commercial lithium-ion cells, but imide salts such as LiFSA have been eschewed in commercial cells because of Al corrosion.(8,21,43,47)Figure 4d,e shows that these fluorinated ethers can passivate the Al surface and are stable at high voltages: similar to commercial 1 M LiPF6 in EC:EMC (ethylene carbonate:ethyl methyl carbonate) (3:7 v/v) electrolytes and much better again than 1 M LiFSA in tetraglyme. Typically, very high LiFSA salt concentrations are required when Al is used, but these fluorinated ether electrolytes allow for normal 1 M salt concentration.(21) Since, we are interested in stability against high-voltage cathode systems, we also performed potentiostatic holds with NMC 811 as the electrode. Figure 4f shows a comparison between the tetraglyme:TTE mixture and DEG-FTEG. The uninhibited current rise observed in Figure 4b,c is not seen with NMC 811, but the tetraglyme:TTE mixture shows higher currents at around 3.8–4 V as observed in Figure 4b. Meanwhile, the DEG-FTEG electrolyte shows much improved stability.The ability to support lithium metal deposition and stripping was also investigated. Supporting efficient cycling of lithium metal is vital, and Figure 4g and Figure S15 show that the electrolytes can support lithium metal deposition and stripping. Figure S16 shows lithium/lithium cells cycled in various electrolytes where DEG-FTriEG can support long-term Li/Li cycling (comparably to tetraglyme and 1 M LiPF6 in EC-EMC commercial electrolytes) albeit with higher overpotentials due to the lower ionic conductivity of the fluorinated electrolytes. In addition, Figure S17 shows Li/Cu cells where a 1 M LiFSA in DEG-FTriEG electrolyte supports more efficient lithium cycling similar to 1 M LiFSA in tetraglyme, but much better than a commercial 1 M LiPF6 in EC:EMC electrolyte.Investigation with a High-Voltage CathodeThe ability of these novel electrolytes to support battery cycling was investigated. Electrolytes with high oxidative stability are desired for next-generation cathode materials with higher energy densities such as NMC 811. To probe the influence of our electrolyte, we use an NMC 811 electrode (theoretical capacity ∼203 mA h/g)(10) with a loading of 4 mg/cm2 and cycled from 3 to 4.4 V. Figure 5a shows a cell with 1 M LiFSA in tetraglyme as the electrolyte with NMC 811 as the cathode cycled at a current rate of C/10. By the first charge, the cathode cannot be charged to the cutoff as undesired side reactions occur.(48) Although the cell can be discharged to low capacity (∼50 mA h/g), the second charge is quite poor as the electrolyte is continuously consumed.(48) In contrast, Figure 5b shows significant improvement in cycling when 1 M LiFSA in DEG-FTriEG is used as the electrolyte even with a 4.4 V charge cutoff. We chose DEG-FTriEG for exploration in a battery because it has the highest ionic conductivity of the compounds explored in this work, and high oxidative stability. The cycling result is exciting because it shows that the significant increase in oxidative stability has enabled cycling of a Ni-rich cathode. Figure 5c shows long-term cycling at C/10 and C/5 current rates for over 100 cycles. The Coulombic efficiency observed in the Li/Cu cell in Figure S17 is lower than that in Figure 5c and may be due to the larger surface area lithium that is deposited in a Li/Cu cell that will continuously react with the electrolyte. The ability to couple high ionic conductivity and high oxidative stability has enabled the operation of an ionically conductive fluorinated ether as the electrolyte in a high-voltage lithium–metal-based battery.Figure 5Figure 5.

Although actuaries do not claim professional expertise in environmental issues, they can be guided by the growing body of knowledge publicly available from reliable scientific sources. Being particularly qualified to deal with modelling financial consequences of risks and uncertainties, the actuarial profession has a duty to provide training and education on climate change and sustainability so that its members are qualified to contribute to the well-being of the society as a whole. In undertaking this exercise, the actuarial profession needs to be cognizant of the fact that even within the climate change science community there are differing views on the nature and amplitude of the risks and the profession should be aware of these differing views Climate change is more than global warming. The rise in average temperature is only one indicator of broader changes also translating into extreme temperatures, drought, flooding, storms, rising sea levels, impacts on food production, and infectious diseases. Although the scientific community has been aware of the link between greenhouse gases (GHGs) and climate change for many years, world leaders have been slow to react and implement measures to mitigate the risks. Key sources of information on climate change are synthesised by the successive reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) created by the United Nations and the World Meteorological Organization in 1988. The prevalent view is that there is a significant anthropogenic contribution to the increase in atmospheric CO2 and other GHGs resulting from fossil fuels emissions and deforestation. Unless new policies are implemented, global warming will exceed the threshold of 2°C agreed to by the parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change for which Canada is a signatory. In 1970, a paper by the Club of Rome pointed out that limited planet resources cannot support unlimited exponential growth. Even renewable resources will be depleted if they cannot be renewed fast enough. By some estimates, we are now using 50% more resources than the sustainable level. The 8 billion population projected by 2030 is twice the 4 billion the earth had to feed as recently as 1974. The pursuit of economic growth is compounding the growth in demand. Global warming is exacerbating the sustainability challenge as it may 5 Research Paper   August 2015 reduce agricultural production and will result in physical damage resulting from extreme weather events, sea-level rise, etc. Mitigating resource scarcity entails adopting new approaches such as a “circular economy”. This refers to an industrial economy that is restorative by definition. It aims to rely on renewable energy; favors recycling; minimizes, tracks, and hopefully eliminates the use of toxic chemicals; and eradicates wastes through careful design. The mitigation strategy can be guided by a new paradigm defining a planetary boundary framework providing a science- based analysis of the risk that human overuse of resources will destabilize the earth system at the planetary scale. The potential impact on actuarial methods and assumptions, especially future growth expectations, is pervasive in the work of actuaries and affects traditional life and non-life, health and pensions areas, investment practices, and newer areas like enterprise risk management. The actuarial profession has created interest groups at the national and international levels to help deepen the understanding of the quantitative aspects of sustainability. It can collect feedback and provide critical reviews of actuarial risk models, establish standards of practice, and promote the adoption of best practices. The North American actuarial associations are jointly creating actuarial climate and risk indexes that will monitor future changes and provide comparisons of benchmarks with the data published by climate scientists. Actuaries can examine the different scenarios for climate change and use of resources to quantify the risks and provide guidance through cost/benefit analyses. Given the multidisciplinary nature of these issues, actuaries can benefit from inputs by non-actuarial entities and work in cooperation with other professionals to serve the public interest through optimizing policy options. Part 1 – Introduction 1.1 Objective Extensive discussions are taking place throughout the world in all forms of media on the subjects of global warming and climate change. These discussions point to the global dangers posed by the earth’s warming. Discussions are also taking place on the related question of resource limitations, given the manner in which humans are using the planet’s limited resources. The purpose of this paper is to provide some education to the members of the CIA. This will consist of providing some background to these issues, identifying some of the current and future risks involved, the possible financial and other impacts posed by these risks, and the worldwide efforts that are being made to minimize these risks. Empowered by a wider access to this knowledge, actuaries can employ their expertise in quantifying these risks and provide guidance to the different publics served by the CIA and thus enhance the well-being of society as a whole. A failure by the actuarial profession to provide advice on these risks could damage its credibility. 6 Research Paper   August 2015 The different sectors of the economy have been examining these risks. A timely input by the actuarial profession would increase the visibility of the profession and create new opportunities. 1.2 Recognition of Risks Due to the nature of the subject, the international discussions on climate change are driven by worldwide climate scientists. There would be a few members of the CIA who would have a good understanding of the issues involved. But the majority of actuaries may not have such understanding. As a result, actuaries have to be guided by the work done by the climate science community. No doubt, even within the climate change science community there are differing views on the nature and amplitude of the risks and actuaries should be aware of these differing views. However, considering the fact that a very large majority of that community is of the view that the risks posed by climate change are serious and could cause disastrous consequences if immediate action is not taken, actuaries have to consider these as distinct possibilities. The fact that climate science is still evolving or there are opposing views would not be a valid reason for the profession to choose to do nothing. As understood from the work done by climate scientists, impacts of climate change will be very wide ranging—extreme climate, increased losses due to floods and storms, rising sea levels, food scarcity, clean water shortage, increased mortality and illness, devaluation of assets, constraints on energy use, and so on. The actuarial community has to obtain a good understanding of the issues involved. Just sitting there without doing anything will severely damage the profession’s reputation. The issue of climate change has been recognized by many professions. The actuarial community can benefit from finding out the perceptions of the different professions of how climate change will affect the work done by them. A classic example of proactive action taken by the actuarial profession would be how it handled the risk of AIDS in the early 1980s. As soon as the world became aware of the AIDS risk, different actuarial bodies designed a variety of infection scenarios that enabled the life insurance industry to set up adequate reserves for the additional mortality. A similar proactive approach can be taken to address the risks posed by climate change. The methods and solutions would be different, but the first steps would be risk recognition and quantification for different scenarios. Part 2 – Climate Change, Process, Reasons, and Future Impacts 2.1 What is Climate Change? Climate change is the subject of how weather patterns change over decades or longer. Climate change takes place due to natural and human influences. Since the Industrial Revolution (i.e., 1750), humans have contributed to climate change through the emissions of GHGs and aerosols, and through changes in land use, resulting in a rise in global 1 temperatures.1 http://www.wmo.int/pages/themes/climate/causes_of_climate_change.phpIncreases in global temperatures may have different impacts, such as an 7 Research Paper   August 2015 increase in storms, floods, droughts, and sea levels, and the decline of ice sheets, sea ice, and glaciers. 2.2 Process of Global Warming The earth receives energy through radiation from the sun. GHGs play an important role of trapping heat, maintaining the earth’s temperature at a level that can sustain life. This phenomenon is called the greenhouse effect and is natural and necessary to support life on earth. Without the greenhouse effect, the earth would be approximately 33°C cooler than it 2 is today. as a result of increased fossil fuel burning and deforestation. The rise in GHGs is the primary cause of global warming over the last century. In recent centuries, humans have contributed to an increase in atmospheric GHGs There are three main datasets that are referenced to measure global surface temperatures 34 since 1850. These datasets show warming of between +0.8°C and +1.0°C since 1900. Since 1950, land-only measurements indicate warming trends of between +1.1°C and +1.3°C, as land temperatures tend to respond more quickly than oceans to the earth’s changing climate. Figure 2.1 shows the global surface temperature trend (1880–2014).\")\n"

    "m = nlp(\"Planet Earth has experienced large shifts in climate over time. In the depths of the last Ice Age, around 20,000 years ago, average temperatures were about 5°C lower than they are today. It looks now as though global warming is likely to heat up the world between 2 and 6°C by the year 2100. Past climate shifts have had dramatic impacts on the land and its inhabitants, particularly with changes in the incidence of floods, droughts, snow and windstorms, and other climate extremes. Those differences in average temperature may seem small, but they have a huge effect on the environment and the lives of plants and animals. In the 19th century, the globe was much colder than it is now. The world was experiencing the end of the Little Ice Age, a time of cooler climate over much of the planet which lasted about 250 years. The first reliable thermometer measurements, taken in the 1850s and 1860s, show temperatures that were close to 1°C below average temperatures today. Our environment has changed already and our everyday lives will be affected — from access to food, water and even land, to health and biodiversity — as the world continues to warm over the next 100 years and beyond. Climate warming really got seriously under way in the 1970s. Recorded temperatures over the planet have now warmed by 1.0°C from the 1880s to 2015. Fifteen of the sixteen warmest years have all been recorded since 2000. The warmer temperatures have had effects on our environment, perhaps the most noticeable of which is the marked loss of ice in most of the mountain glaciers of the world. Since 1950, there has been a massive retreat of mountain glaciers. From 1980 to 2011 these glaciers lost, on average, 1.4 metres of water equivalent (the depth of water that results if the whole snow pack melts) from their surfaces to the oceans. This contributes to sea-level rise. Another impact of glacier melt is that the extra snow melting under warmer temperatures will provide more fresh water in winter and spring where river flows are low. The melting glaciers are also expected to bring a reduction to winter electricity requirements. A change in the world's late 20th century climate occurred in the mid-1970s with accelerated warming, coupled with an increase in El Niño events in the Pacific Ocean. There was an immediate impact over areas especially affected by this climate phenomenon, such as in Australia, the Pacific and the Americas. El Niño events magnify the effects of global warming. The more frequent El Niños have caused more droughts in Australia and southern Africa and more floods in parts of South America and western areas of North America. Just before the commencement of the 21st century, the Pacific Basin entered a climate phase characterised by more frequent La Niña events. This was heralded by a more energetic North Atlantic hurricane season, flooding events in Australia, and other climate extremes. Temperatures continued to increase, but more slowly than in the late 20th century, while the oceans absorbed heat at a rapid rate. The climate switched again in late 2014 to the phase characterised by more frequent El Niño events, which warm the atmosphere. The severe 2015/16 El Niño episode has been ranked as one of the three strongest in records back to the late 19th century. Dramatic impacts occurred, including especially severe coral bleaching on the Great Barrier Reef. This pushed up tropical cyclone activity over the western South 2 Pacific, especially near Vanuatu, Fiji and Tonga, and produced severe drought in parts of Africa and Australia. The change in climate forces created by warming will alter the pattern of climate extremes. Warmer air holds more moisture,which means that heavy rainfall and floods are more likely. Global surface temperature record (land and marine) 1850-2015,relative to the 1961-1990 mean This time series, from the Climatic Research Unit (CRU), shows the combined global land and marine surface temperature record from 1850 to 2015.1850 marks the commencement of reliable instrumental observations. At the same time higher average temperatures mean dramatically fewer frosts and more heatwaves and droughts. Climate scientists are quite clear that greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are increasing, and that these must have an impact on climate. There is incontrovertible evidence that the amounts of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere started rising at the start of the Industrial Revolution, and are continuing to do so at an accelerating rate. The greenhouse gases — carbon dioxide, methane and chlorofluoro-carbons (CFCs) — trap heat in the atmosphere. The basic laws of physics require that an increase in these gases will change climate. It is the considered opinion of the world's most respected climate scientists, who were asked by the United Nations in 1988 to report on how rising amounts in greenhouse gases might change global climate. The latest 2013 conclusions from the International Panel on Climate Change is that “continued emissions of greenhouse gases will cause further warming and changes in all components of the climate system. Limiting climate change will require substantial and sustained reductions of greenhouse gas emissions.” As the numbers of impacts grow with increasing global mean temperature, interactions between them might increasingly occur, compounding the overall impact. For example, significant pressure on water resources and changes in the hydrological cycle, combined with a large shock to agricultural production due to extreme temperatures across many regions, will most probably affect both human health and livelihoods. This might flow into effects on economic development, hindering growth in GDP by reducing a population's work capacity. As warming progresses toward 4°C, combined with nonclimate-related social, economic and population stresses, the risk of crossing critical social system thresholds will grow. Those existing institutions that would have supported adaptation actions very likely become much less operative and even fail. One example is a risk that sea-level rise in atoll countries exceeds the capacity of controlled, adaptive migration, resulting in the need for complete relocation of a sovereign nation. Stresses on human health, such as heatwaves, 3 malnutrition, and decreasing quality of drinking water due to seawater intrusion, have the potential to overburden health-care systems to a point where adaptation is no longer possible, and dislocation is forced. The Mauna Loa carbon dioxide (CO2) record —1958 to 2016 Since the Industrial Revolution, about 360 billion tonnes of carbon have been emitted by humans into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide (CO2) from burning of fossil fuels, deforestation and land use. Atmospheric measurements show that about half of this CO2 remains in the atmosphere and that, so far, the ocean and terrestrial sinks have steadily increased. If the pace of the last decade continues, CO2 will reach 450 ppm by the year 2040. CO2 is the most important manmade greenhouse gas, produced mainly by the burning of fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas. The pace of the rise depends strongly on how much fossil fuel is used globally. If atmospheric CO2 concentrations double, global average surface temperatures would eventually warm between 2 and 5°C above pre-industrial levels. In December 2015 the 195 nations of the world negotiated the Paris Agreement within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The principal aim was to hold the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and aim to reach global peaking of greenhouse gas emissions as soon as possible. As at the end of April 2016, 177 countries had signed the agreement. It will enter into force only if 55 countries that produce at least 55% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions ratify it. Current pledges of Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) emissions reductions give 3 to 4°C of warming. However, the contributions should be reported every five years and are to be registered by the UNFCCC Secretariat. Each new reduction target should be more ambitious than the previous one. Although further warming will occur, the Paris Agreement provides the mechanism where countries ratchet up their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) over time. This represents the opportunity and hope for global greenhouse gas mitigation. Only time will tell if the political commitment is there – but virtually all countries have accepted the negotiated agreement, which is a bottom up approach. To really work, it still requires ratification and then some measure of enforcement! While past climate changes have had huge effects on life and land in the world, it is impossible to say with any certainty what any specific effects will be in every region, particularly because the change will happen much more quickly than 4 ever before. The approach scientists use to deal with these uncertainties is to develop 'scenarios' that describe a plausible range of future climates consistent with the latest climate modelling results. Uncertainty bedevils components of the science of climate change. It will not be eliminated any time soon, so the best way to help policy makers is to try to forge a consensus about the degree of confidence that can be assessed and provide climate scenarios for guidance. Wildlife, native forests and coral reefs are expected to be hit hard by the changing climate. The current climate scenarios show that temperatures will rise too fast for many species and they will be unable to adjust quickly enough to establish themselves in more suitable climates several hundred kilometres away. Without human intervention there is a high chance they will become extinct. The speed at which the changing climate is driving both animals and plants by creating new barriers and boundaries is faster today as compared to the prehistoric change in the last 20,000 years. There are risks to coral reefs where sea temperatures in many tropical regions have increased by almost 1°C over the past 100 years, and are currently increasing at 1.2°C per century. Mass coral bleaching has occurred in association with episodes of elevated sea temperatures over the past 20 years and this mass bleaching has resulted in significant losses of live coral in many parts of the world. The rapidity of the changes that are predicted indicates a major problem for tropical marine ecosystems. Insect species play fundamental roles in providing services for animals and plants, such as pollination of native plants and crops, the turnover of nutrients, and reducing pest species via\")"

Climate change takes place due to natural and human influences. Since the Industrial Revolution (i.e., 1750), humans have contributed to climate change through the emissions of GHGs and aerosols, and through changes in land use, resulting in a rise in global 1 temperatures.1 http://www.wmo.int/pages/themes/climate/causes_of_climate_change.phpIncreases in global temperatures may have different impacts, such as an 7 Research Paper   August 2015 increase in storms, floods, droughts, and sea levels, and the decline of ice sheets, sea ice, and glaciers. 2.2 Process of Global Warming The earth receives energy through radiation from the sun. GHGs play an important role of trapping heat, maintaining the earth’s temperature at a level that can sustain life. This phenomenon is called the greenhouse effect and is natural and necessary to support life on earth. Without the greenhouse effect, the earth would be approximately 33°C cooler than it 2 is today. as a result of increased fossil fuel burning and deforestation.

    "m_stopw = (\"Planet Earth has experienced large shifts in climate over time. In the depths of the last Ice Age, around 20,000 years ago, average temperatures were about 5°C lower than they are today. It looks now as though global warming is likely to heat up the world between 2 and 6°C by the year 2100. Past climate shifts have had dramatic impacts on the land and its inhabitants, particularly with changes in the incidence of floods, droughts, snow and windstorms, and other climate extremes. Those differences in average temperature may seem small, but they have a huge effect on the environment and the lives of plants and animals. In the 19th century, the globe was much colder than it is now. The world was experiencing the end of the Little Ice Age, a time of cooler climate over much of the planet which lasted about 250 years. The first reliable thermometer measurements, taken in the 1850s and 1860s, show temperatures that were close to 1°C below average temperatures today. Our environment has changed already and our everyday lives will be affected — from access to food, water and even land, to health and biodiversity — as the world continues to warm over the next 100 years and beyond. Climate warming really got seriously under way in the 1970s. Recorded temperatures over the planet have now warmed by 1.0°C from the 1880s to 2015. Fifteen of the sixteen warmest years have all been recorded since 2000. The warmer temperatures have had effects on our environment, perhaps the most noticeable of which is the marked loss of ice in most of the mountain glaciers of the world. Since 1950, there has been a massive retreat of mountain glaciers. From 1980 to 2011 these glaciers lost, on average, 1.4 metres of water equivalent (the depth of water that results if the whole snow pack melts) from their surfaces to the oceans. This contributes to sea-level rise. Another impact of glacier melt is that the extra snow melting under warmer temperatures will provide more fresh water in winter and spring where river flows are low. The melting glaciers are also expected to bring a reduction to winter electricity requirements. A change in the world's late 20th century climate occurred in the mid-1970s with accelerated warming, coupled with an increase in El Niño events in the Pacific Ocean. There was an immediate impact over areas especially affected by this climate phenomenon, such as in Australia, the Pacific and the Americas. El Niño events magnify the effects of global warming. The more frequent El Niños have caused more droughts in Australia and southern Africa and more floods in parts of South America and western areas of North America. Just before the commencement of the 21st century, the Pacific Basin entered a climate phase characterised by more frequent La Niña events. This was heralded by a more energetic North Atlantic hurricane season, flooding events in Australia, and other climate extremes. Temperatures continued to increase, but more slowly than in the late 20th century, while the oceans absorbed heat at a rapid rate. The climate switched again in late 2014 to the phase characterised by more frequent El Niño events, which warm the atmosphere. The severe 2015/16 El Niño episode has been ranked as one of the three strongest in records back to the late 19th century. Dramatic impacts occurred, including especially severe coral bleaching on the Great Barrier Reef. This pushed up tropical cyclone activity over the western South 2 Pacific, especially near Vanuatu, Fiji and Tonga, and produced severe drought in parts of Africa and Australia. The change in climate forces created by warming will alter the pattern of climate extremes. Warmer air holds more moisture,which means that heavy rainfall and floods are more likely.

Limiting climate change will require substantial and sustained reductions of greenhouse gas emissions.” As the numbers of impacts grow with increasing global mean temperature, interactions between them might increasingly occur, compounding the overall impact. For example, significant pressure on water resources and changes in the hydrological cycle, combined with a large shock to agricultural production due to extreme temperatures across many regions, will most probably affect both human health and livelihoods. This might flow into effects on economic development, hindering growth in GDP by reducing a population's work capacity. As warming progresses toward 4°C, combined with nonclimate-related social, economic and population stresses, the risk of crossing critical social system thresholds will grow. Those existing institutions that would have supported adaptation actions very likely become much less operative and even fail. One example is a risk that sea-level rise in atoll countries exceeds the capacity of controlled, adaptive migration, resulting in the need for complete relocation of a sovereign nation. Stresses on human health, such as heatwaves, 3 malnutrition, and decreasing quality of drinking water due to seawater intrusion, have the potential to overburden health-care systems to a point where adaptation is no longer possible, and dislocation is forced. The Mauna Loa carbon dioxide (CO2) record —1958 to 2016 Since the Industrial Revolution, about 360 billion tonnes of carbon have been emitted by humans into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide (CO2) from burning of fossil fuels, deforestation and land use. Atmospheric measurements show that about half of this CO2 remains in the atmosphere and that, so far, the ocean and terrestrial sinks have steadily increased. If the pace of the last decade continues, CO2 will reach 450 ppm by the year 2040. CO2 is the most important manmade greenhouse gas, produced mainly by the burning of fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas. The pace of the rise depends strongly on how much fossil fuel is used globally. If atmospheric CO2 concentrations double, global average surface temperatures would eventually warm between 2 and 5°C above pre-industrial levels. In December 2015 the 195 nations of the world negotiated the Paris Agreement within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The principal aim was to hold the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and aim to reach global peaking of greenhouse gas emissions as soon as possible. As at the end of April 2016, 177 countries had signed the agreement. It will enter into force only if 55 countries that produce at least 55% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions ratify it. Current pledges of Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) emissions reductions give 3 to 4°C of warming. However, the contributions should be reported every five years and are to be registered by the UNFCCC Secretariat. Each new reduction target should be more ambitious than the previous one. Although further warming will occur, the Paris Agreement provides the mechanism where countries ratchet up their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) over time. This represents the opportunity and hope for global greenhouse gas mitigation. Only time will tell if the political commitment is there – but virtually all countries have accepted the negotiated agreement, which is a bottom up approach. To really work, it still requires ratification and then some measure of enforcement! While past climate changes have had huge effects on life and land in the world, it is impossible to say with any certainty what any specific effects will be in every region, particularly because the change will happen much more quickly than 4 ever before. The approach scientists use to deal with these uncertainties is to develop 'scenarios' that describe a plausible range of future climates consistent with the latest climate modelling results. Uncertainty bedevils components of the science of climate change. It will not be eliminated any time soon, so the best way to help policy makers is to try to forge a consensus about the degree of confidence that can be assessed and provide climate scenarios for guidance. Wildlife, native forests and coral reefs are expected to be hit hard by the changing climate. The current climate scenarios show that temperatures will rise too fast for many species and they will be unable to adjust quickly enough to establish themselves in more suitable climates several hundred kilometres away. Without human intervention there is a high chance they will become extinct. The speed at which the changing climate is driving both animals and plants by creating new barriers and boundaries is faster today as compared to the prehistoric change in the last 20,000 years. There are risks to coral reefs where sea temperatures in many tropical regions have increased by almost 1°C over the past 100 years, and are currently increasing at 1.2°C per century. Mass coral bleaching has occurred in association with episodes of elevated sea temperatures over the past 20 years and this mass bleaching has resulted in significant losses of live coral in many parts of the world. The rapidity of the changes that are predicted indicates a major problem for tropical marine ecosystems. Insect species play fundamental roles in providing services for animals and plants, such as pollination of native plants and crops, the turnover of nutrients, and reducing pest species via\")"
